### **4. System Architecture**

**4.1 High-Level Diagram**

(We'll use a table and bullet points to describe the architecture, but again using visual diagram tool is recommended)

| Component | Description | Technologies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Client (Web App)** | Handles UI, user interactions, data display, session storage and communication with the backend. | Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, Axios, Web Speech API |
| **Backend (API)** | Provides API endpoints for assessment, learning path generation, exercise data, user management, and progress tracking. Deals with database | Node.js, Nest.js, TypeScript, Webpack (for hot refresh) |
| **Database** | Stores user data, learning paths, exercise data, progress metrics, language data, and other persistent information. | PostgreSQL |
| **AI Engine** | (Future) Processes assessment results, generates personalized learning paths, adapts to user progress, and provides recommendations. | (Future) Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. |

**Component Interactions:**

- The **Client** sends requests (using Axios or similar) to the **Backend API**.
- The **Backend** uses **TypeORM** (or a similar ORM) to interact with the **PostgreSQL Database**.
- The **Backend** will eventually communicate with the **AI Engine** for personalization features.
- The **Client** receives responses from the **Backend** and updates the UI using **React** and **Redux**.

**4.2 Component Descriptions**

- **Client (Next.js Web App):**
    - **UI Layer:** React components styled with Tailwind CSS, organized into pages (using Next.js's file-based routing) and reusable components.
    - **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for global application state (user data, learning path, assessment state, etc.). Consider using `createAsyncThunk` for handling asynchronous actions.
    - **Networking:** Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
    - **Routing:** Next.js's built-in file-based routing for navigation between pages.
    - **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js's data fetching methods (`getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`) to fetch data from the backend API efficiently.
    - **Web Speech API:** Utilize the browser's Web Speech API for speech recognition (e.g., during pronunciation assessments).
- **Backend (Node.js/Nest.js API):**
    - **Framework:** Nest.js to structure the backend application, handle routing, and manage dependencies.
    - **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and improved code maintainability.
    - **API Endpoints:** RESTful API endpoints using Nest.js controllers and services.
    - **Database Interaction:** TypeORM (or a similar ORM like Prisma) to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
    - **Webpack:** For hot module replacement during development, speeding up the development process.
    - **Authentication:** Implement user authentication (e.g., using Passport.js or a similar library) to secure API endpoints.
    - **Validation:** Use class-validator and Nest.js's built-in validation pipes to validate incoming data.
- **Database (PostgreSQL):**
    - **Relational Database:** PostgreSQL to store structured data efficiently.
    - **Schema Design:** Design a well-structured database schema to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.
    - **Indexing:** Use appropriate indexes to optimize query performance.
- **AI Engine (Future):**
    - using Gemini 2.0 flash with google sdk.
    - handles app logic and behaviour
    - gives recomendations about next steps, critique zones, builds learning plan and etc.

**4.3 Data Model**

(The data model will be very similar to the Flutter version. You might need some minor adjustments for database-specific considerations.)

(Use the same data models as before and add new if needed)

    - **Database:** Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Heroku Postgres)

### **6. Development Process**

- **Frontend:**
    - Use `npx create-next-app` to set up a new Next.js project.
    - Install necessary dependencies: `npm install typescript tailwindcss @reduxjs/toolkit axios`
    - Configure Tailwind CSS.
    - Set up Redux store and slices.
    - Develop React components, using Next.js for pages and routing.
    - Implement data fetching using Next.js's methods.
    - Integrate the Web Speech API for speech recognition.
- **Backend:**
    - Use the Nest.js CLI to set up a new project: `nest new lessay-backend`
    - Install dependencies: `npm install @nestjs/typeorm typeorm pg class-validator` (and others as needed)
    - Configure TypeORM to connect to PostgreSQL.
    - Create Nest.js modules, controllers, and services for your API endpoints.
    - Implement authentication and validation.
    - Set up Webpack for hot module replacement during development.
- **Database:**
    - Create a PostgreSQL database (locally or on a cloud provider).
    - Define the database schema using TypeORM entities.
    - Use TypeORM migrations to manage schema changes.

### **7. Security Considerations**

- **Authentication:**
    - Implement secure user authentication on the backend using Passport.js or a similar library.
    - Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or a similar token-based approach for managing user sessions.
    - Store passwords securely using bcrypt or a similar hashing algorithm.
- **Authorization:**
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain API endpoints based on user roles.
- **Data Validation:**
    - Validate all incoming data on the backend using class-validator and Nest.js validation pipes.
    - Sanitize user inputs on the frontend to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **HTTPS:**
    - Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
    - Configure CORS on the backend to allow requests from your frontend domain.
- **Database Security:**
    - Secure your PostgreSQL database by setting strong passwords, restricting access, and using encryption if necessary.
- **Regular Security Audits:**
    - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

### **8. Deployment Strategy**

- **Frontend:**
    - **Vercel:** Vercel is a popular choice for deploying Next.js applications. It provides automatic deployments from Git, serverless functions, and other features that make deployment easy.
    - **Netlify:** Netlify is another good option for deploying static sites and web applications.
- **Backend:**
    - **Cloud Platforms:** Deploy your Nest.js application to a cloud platform like AWS (using EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, or ECS), Google Cloud (using Compute Engine, App Engine, or Cloud Run), Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
    - **Containerization:** Use Docker to containerize your backend application and database for easier deployment and management.
    - **CI/CD:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or CircleCI) to automate the build, testing, and deployment process.
- **Database:**
    - Use a managed PostgreSQL service like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Heroku Postgres to simplify database management.

### **9. Scalability and Performance**

- **Frontend:**
    - **Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically performs code splitting, which helps reduce the initial bundle size and improve loading times.
    - **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js's built-in `Image` component to optimize images for different screen sizes and formats.
    - **Caching:** Leverage browser caching and CDN caching to improve performance.
    - **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Use Next.js's `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` to pre-render pages at build time whenever possible. This can significantly improve performance and reduce server load.
    - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Use ISR to update static pages in the background, ensuring that content is fresh without sacrificing performance.
- **Backend:**
    - **Database Optimization:**
        - Use appropriate indexes to speed up database queries.
        - Optimize database schema for performance.
        - Consider using a connection pool to manage database connections efficiently.
        - Use read replicas for read-heavy operations.
    - **Caching:** Implement caching at the API level (e.g., using Redis) to reduce database load.
    - **Load Balancing:** Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your backend application.
    - **Asynchronous Processing:** Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, SQS) to handle long-running tasks asynchronously.
    - **Horizontal Scaling:** Design your backend to be horizontally scalable (add more instances as needed).
- **AI Engine:**
    - (Same as before - optimize models, consider hardware acceleration, use distributed training if necessary)

### **10. Future Enhancements**

(These can remain largely the same, but consider the web context)

- **Gamification:** (No changes needed)
- **Social Features:** (No changes needed)
- **Community Forum:** (No changes needed)
- **Offline Mode:** For a web app, offline mode is more challenging. Consider using service workers and caching strategies to provide some level of offline functionality, but full offline access might not be feasible.
- **Spaced Repetition:** (No changes needed)
- **Personalized Feedback:** (No changes needed)
- **Augmented Reality (AR):** Web AR is becoming more mature (e.g., using WebXR). Explore AR features for immersive language learning experiences if it aligns with your goals.
- **More Languages:** (No changes needed)
