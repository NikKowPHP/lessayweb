Okay, let's break down the implementation of the frontend for the "lessay" web app, step-by-step, focusing on best practices.

**Frontend Implementation Steps**

**Step 1: Project Setup with Next.js**

1. **Initialize Next.js Project:** Create a new Next.js project using `create-next-app` and choose TypeScript. Name the project `lessay-frontend`. This sets up a basic Next.js project with recommended defaults.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install essential packages: Tailwind CSS for styling, Redux Toolkit for state management, Axios for API requests, and any other necessary libraries like `localforage` for local storage.

**Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS**

1. **Tailwind CSS Setup:** Follow the official Tailwind CSS documentation to integrate it into your Next.js project. This involves creating `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files and configuring them appropriately.
2. **Global Styles:** Set up global styles in a CSS file within the `styles` directory. Import this file into the `_app.tsx` to apply styles across the entire application.

**Step 3: Set Up Redux Store**

1. **Create Redux Store:** In the `store` directory, create `index.ts` to configure the Redux store using `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit.
2. **Define Redux Slices:** Create a `slices` directory within `store`. Inside, create files like `userSlice.ts` and `learningSlice.ts` to define the initial state, reducers, and actions related to user data, learning paths, and other core features. Use `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit.
3. **Typed Redux Hooks:** Create `hooks.ts` in the `store` directory to define typed versions of `useSelector` and `useDispatch` for better type safety when interacting with the Redux store.

**Step 4: Create Basic App Structure and Navigation**

1. **Folder Structure:** Organize your project with folders like in src `components`, `pages`, `public`, `styles`, `lib`, `context`, and `hooks`, as described in the Code Structure section.
2. **Pages:** Start creating basic pages within the `pages` directory. For example:
    *   `index.tsx` (Landing Page)
    *   `learning/path.tsx` (Learning Path Page)
    *   `learning/assessment.tsx` (Initial Assessment Page)
3. **Layout Component:** Create a layout component in `components` to define a common structure for your pages (header, footer, navigation). Use this layout in `_app.tsx` to wrap page content.
4. **Navigation:** Implement navigation using Next.js's built-in `Link` component or create a custom navigation component. Place the navigation in your layout component.

**Step 5: Implement the Landing Page**

1. **Design:** Create the UI for the landing page (`index.tsx`) using Tailwind CSS classes. Include a clear explanation of the app's purpose and a "Get Started" button.
2. **Get Started Button:** Make the "Get Started" button navigate to the Sign Up/Login page.

**Step 6: Implement Sign Up/Login Page**

1. **Page Creation:** Create a page for Sign Up/Login (e.g., `pages/auth/index.tsx`).
2. **UI Design:** Design the page with forms for email/password sign-up/login and buttons for social media login options.
3. **Form Handling:** Use React state (or a form library like `react-hook-form`) to manage form input values.
4. **API Integration:** When a user submits the form, make an API request (using Axios) to your backend's authentication endpoints.

**Step 7: Implement Language Selection**

1. **Page Creation:** Create a page for language selection (e.g., `pages/onboarding/language.tsx`).
2. **UI Design:** Use dropdown menus or a similar UI to allow users to select their native language and the language they want to learn.
3. **State Management:** Store the selected languages in the Redux store (e.g., in the `userSlice`).

**Step 8: Implement Initial Assessment Introduction**

1. **Page Creation:** Create a page to introduce the initial assessment (e.g., `pages/onboarding/assessment-intro.tsx`).
2. **Content:** Explain the purpose of the assessment, the types of questions, and how the results will be used.
3. **Start Button:** Include a "Start Assessment" button that navigates to the first assessment question.

**Step 9: Implement Pronunciation Assessment**

1. **Page Creation:** Create a page for the pronunciation assessment (e.g., `pages/onboarding/assessment/pronunciation.tsx`).
2. **Web Speech API Integration:** Create a custom hook (e.g., `useRecording.ts`) in the `hooks` directory to encapsulate the logic for using the Web Speech API to record audio.
3. **UI Design:**
    *   Display the word or phrase to pronounce.
    *   Include a record button that uses your custom hook to start and stop recording.
    *   Provide playback controls for the user's recording.
    *   Add "Submit" and "Retry" buttons.
4. **API Interaction:** When the user submits the recording, send it to the backend API for analysis.

**Step 10: Implement Vocabulary, Grammar, and Comprehension Assessments**

1. **Page Creation:** Create pages for each assessment type (e.g., `pages/onboarding/assessment/vocabulary.tsx`, `pages/onboarding/assessment/grammar.tsx`, `pages/onboarding/assessment/comprehension.tsx`).
2. **UI Design:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** Display images and use the recording hook for voice input.
    *   **Grammar:** Provide input fields, drag-and-drop elements, or other UI as needed for sentence completion or manipulation tasks.
    *   **Comprehension:** Embed video or audio players and display multiple-choice questions.
3. **API Interaction:** Submit user responses to the backend API for evaluation.

**Step 11: Implement Assessment Results and Learning Path Generation**

1. **Page Creation:** Create a page to display assessment results and the generated learning path (e.g., `pages/learning/path.tsx`).
2. **API Request:** Fetch the assessment results and learning path data from the backend API. Use Next.js's data fetching methods (e.g., `getServerSideProps`) to fetch data on the server-side if needed for faster initial page load.
3. **UI Design:**
    *   Display a summary of the user's performance in each skill area.
    *   Present the learning path as a visual timeline or list of steps, as described in the wireframe descriptions.
    *   Highlight the current step and use clear status indicators (locked, current, completed).

**Step 12: Implement Learning Step Pages**

1. **Page Creation:** Create dynamic pages for different learning step types (e.g., `pages/learning/step/[type].tsx`). Use Next.js's dynamic routing to handle different step types.
2. **UI Design:**
    *   **Practice Exercises:** Design UI elements based on the exercise type (recording, sentence completion, multiple-choice).
    *   **Video Lessons:** Embed video players with controls and potentially subtitles.
3. **API Interaction:** Fetch exercise or video data from the backend based on the step type and ID.

**Step 13: Implement Progress Checks**

1. **Page Creation:** Create a page for progress checks (e.g., `pages/learning/progress-check.tsx`). This page can be similar to the initial assessment pages but tailored to specific skills.
2. **API Interaction:** Fetch progress check questions and submit user responses to the backend.

**Step 14: Implement Profile and Settings Pages (Optional)**

1. **Page Creation:** Create pages for user profiles and settings (e.g., `pages/profile.tsx`, `pages/settings.tsx`).
2. **UI Design:** Design forms to allow users to view and update their profile information, manage notification settings, etc.
3. **API Interaction:** Fetch and update user data through the backend API.

**Step 15: Implement Responsiveness and Accessibility**

1. **Responsive Design:** Use Tailwind CSS's responsive modifiers to ensure your app looks good on all screen sizes. Test on different devices and browsers.
2. **Accessibility:** Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to make your app usable for people with disabilities. Use semantic HTML, provide ARIA attributes when needed, and ensure keyboard navigability.

**Step 16: Testing and Refinement**

1. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for your components, hooks, and utility functions using a testing library like Jest and React Testing Library.
2. **End-to-End Testing:** Consider end-to-end testing with tools like Cypress or Playwright to test user flows across multiple pages.
3. **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from real users and iterate on your design and implementation.

**Step 17: Deployment**

1. **Build:** Use `next build` to create an optimized production build of your application.
2. **Deploy:** Deploy your Next.js app to a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify. These platforms provide easy integration with Next.js and offer features like automatic deployments from Git.

Remember that this is a high-level overview. Each step involves many smaller tasks and considerations. Break down the work into smaller, manageable pieces, and focus on building a solid foundation for your web app.
